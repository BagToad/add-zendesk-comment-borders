# Add Zendesk Comment Borders User Script

This user script is primarily designed for use with the Violentmonkey extension, but should also work with other similar user script manager extensions.

The purpose of this script is to enhance visibility and readability on Zendesk Agent Workspace by introducing borders to comments, similar to the borders that were previously present in past iterations of the Zendesk UI.

## Description

The script introduces a simple CSS tweak that applies a border to each Zendesk comment visible in the Agent Workspace. 

## Installation Instructions

1.  First, ensure you have a user script manager extension like Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey, or Greasemonkey installed in your web browser. If not, download and install from your browser's respective extension store.
    
2.  Once equipped with an appropriate user script manager extension, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BagToad/add-zendesk-comment-borders/main/add-comment-borders.user.js) to direct your browser to the raw user script file.
    
3.  Your user script manager should detect this and prompt you to install the script. Proceed to install.
    
4.  Congratulations! The script is now installed. Navigate to your Zendesk Agent Workspace and refresh the tab to see the style changes.
